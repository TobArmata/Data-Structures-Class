These classes are interconnected and run off each other.

This project is about a hospitol, we made ways for incoming paients to queue and be checked in and to see a doctor. After they are placed in another queue to see a Doctor. After they see their doctor they move to the discharge stack so they can be processed fully at a later time.

The Line Class to be checked in is an Array Based Queue, first come first serve. After they are checked they are automatically moved to a avaible doctor that is chosen by the operator.

The DocLine Class is a Linked List; each doctor has their own queue in the form of a linked list and its a first come first serve. This allows for each doctor to handle their own queues. After they are examined and discharged they are automatically moved to the DisCharged Stack.
	The PNode Class converts the paient to a Node so it can be used easily in the DocLine class.

The DisCharged Class is a Node Based Stack, this puts the first discharged into the stack then the next; first in, first out. This allows the operator to process the people who left the earlist down to the person who left first.
